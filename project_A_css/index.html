                <p>Vermis Saltatorius</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>First documented in 1879 by Dr. Elara Finch</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The family Saltatoridae is composed of unique aquatic invertebrates known for their rhythmic,
                    dance-like locomotion. Often called “Saltators,” members of Saltatoridae exhibit movement patterns
                    that resemble fluid dances, enabling them to maneuver gracefully through water. This distinctive
                    movement has led to their colloquial name as the "Dancing Worm Family."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Dancer worms thrive in the damp, shadowed waters of marshlands and slow-moving rivers, especially in
                    regions with high mineral content. The Indigo Marshlands, where they were first discovered, remain
                    their primary habitat, but they have since been found in scattered locations across dense, humid
                    Ecosystems.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Thin, faintly glowing stripes run along the sides of their bodies, intensifying near the head and
                    tail. This glow is emitted by specialized light-producing cells known as luminocytes, which are also
                    responsible for their communication through “Lumen Language".</p>

                Dancer worms are believed to communicate through subtle shifts in their glow intensity, a phenomenon
                referred to as “Lumen Language” by researchers. This bioluminescent language is theorized to play a role
                in mating displays, group coordination, and even warning signals when predators approach. Though most
                commonly found in shallow marshes, recent discoveries suggest they may also inhabit deep oceanic
                trenches, where their unique glow and synchronized movements would be beneficial in the dark.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                <li> Avoid Direct
                    Touching: Due to their delicate bodies and highly sensitive skin, Dancer worms can be easily harmed
                    by
                    direct contact. Observers are encouraged to use special tools or gloves if handling them is
                    essential.</li>


                <li> No Bright Lights: Dancer worms are light-sensitive and can be disoriented or harmed by bright,
                    artificial lights. Visitors are advised to use low-level lighting and avoid flash photography to
                    respect
                    the worms' natural light rhythm.</li>


                <li>Observe from a Distance: When Dancer worms congregate in their "dance formations," disrupting their
                    movement can interfere with their social behaviors. Observing from a respectful distance allows them
                    to
                    move undisturbed.</li>


                <li>Do Not Remove from Habitat: Dancer worms have proven difficult to sustain outside of their native
                    environments, and removal can result in their death and disrupt local ecosystems. Conservation
                    guidelines prohibit capturing or relocating these worms.</li>


                <li>Join During "Lumen Festivals": Many reserves host controlled “Lumen Festival” viewings, where small
                    groups of visitors can witness the worms’ mesmerizing displays safely.</li>
